# @vizality/types

Package containing all of the type definitions used by Vizality. Created for [Vizality](https://vizality.com) plugin developers.

## Usage

To utilize this in your project, first go to your project's root working directory and run:

```bash
npm install @vizality/types --save-dev
```

And that's all there is to it!

You should now be able to use Vizality types in your project.

## Namespaces

A few global namespace types are added by this package, but most types are namesapced under two broad namespaces and shouldn't need to be imported: `Vizality` and `Discord`

Self-explanatory, but `Vizality` namespaced types are Vizality-specific types, while `Discord` namespaced types are Discord-specific types.
